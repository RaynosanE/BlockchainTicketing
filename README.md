# BlockchainTicketing
Cloud Computing - Final Project

The intention of this project is to develop a blockchain-based ticket deployment web application. 
Due to its decentralized nature, this project may also be termed as a full-stack DApp. 

For the purposes of marking, one should follow the following instructions in order to test the deployed DApp through its private blockchain.
